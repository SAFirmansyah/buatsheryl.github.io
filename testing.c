Bear with me, I'm not all too confident to even try to send this to you because i was afraid that you wouldnt even bother to open it. I also feel like I'm a nobody to you, maybe for now. In the future? We shall see.\n\n You may notice that this things is very simple, perhaps not as cute as you saw a couple of times in your fyp. But yeah, I'm still learning new stuff. I did not even know if this thing was gonna even work. Aaaaaanywaysssss, maybe that was too much of an opening, so straight to the point\n\n");
